# Example Code for MDS analysis
Author: Carlos Andres Melo Luna


The MDS code here proposed employs the PULP library to solve the integer linear problem.

The code is Python 3.X based. Require the following packages to run:

NetworkX, Pulp, CSV, Matplotlib.

## Usage

Run the graph_plot.py file:
<pre><code>python3 graph_plot.py 
</code></pre>
The output files are in the folder /test-files/ILP-output and correspond to the plotted network and the CSV file.

Please send any questions you might have about the code or algorithms to andres.melo@lrc.systems.
